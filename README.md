# Calculator

A simple C++ console-based calculator project as part of my DSA internship preparation. This project demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and will evolve with stack-based expression evaluation.

## Progress Log

### Week 2: May 23â€“29, 2025
- **Day 1 (May 23)**:
  - Started with basic addition and subtraction functionality.
  - File: `0 - Calculator.cpp`
  - Technologies: C++, STL.
 
  - **Day 2 (May 24)**:
  - Added multiplication and division functionality.
  - File: `0 - Calculator.cpp`
 
  - **Day 3 (May 25)**:
  - Added basic stack-based expression evaluation.
  - File: `0 - Calculator.cpp`
 
  - **Day 4 (May 26)**:
  - Enhanced stack-based evaluation with full operator precedence.
  - File: `0 - Calculator.cpp`

## Future Plans
- Add multiplication, division, and stack-based expression evaluation.
- Integrate with DSA-CPP repo for comprehensive learning.
